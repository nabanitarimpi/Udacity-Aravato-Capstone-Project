# Customer segmentatioon project

In this project, we work with datasets containing demographic information about the customers of a mail-order company in Germany as well as that of general population of the country. The main aim is to use these information to identify individuals from the population who are more likely to turn into future customers of the company and also predict the corresponding probabilities. The datasets, however, cannot be made public.

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code :
- **Python 3.7+**
- **NumPy** (`pip install numpy`)
- **pandas** (`pip install pandas`)
- **SciPy** (`pip install scipy`)
- **scikit-learn** (`pip install scikit-learn`)
- **XGBoost** (`pip install xgboost`)

## List of files
